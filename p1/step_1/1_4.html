    <p><h1>The <strong><sup>Stream</sup></strong></h1><h2> now <sub>dominates</sub>the <sup>way</sup> people <sub>receive</sub> information <sup>on</sup> the <sub>web.</sub></h2></p>

    <p><h3><sub>Fewer</sub> users <sup>are</sup> directly <sub>checking</sub> dedicated <sup>webpages,</sup> instead <sub>getting</sub> fed <sup>by</sup> a <sub>never</sub>ending <sup>flow</sup> of <sub>information</sub> that’s <sup>picked</sup> for <sub>them</sub> by <sup>complex</sup> –and <sub>secretive</sub> — <sup>algorithms.</sup></h3></p>
    <br />

<p><h2>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe <sup><strong>Stream</strong></sup> means <sub>you</sub> don’t <sup>need</sup> to <sub>open</sub> so <sup>many</sup> websites <sub>any</sub> more. <sup>You</sup> don’t <sub>need</sub> numerous <sup>tabs.</sup></h2></p>

 <p><h3>You don’t <sup>even</sup> need a <sub>web</sub> browser.</h3></p>
  <p><h1>You <sub>open</sub> Twitter <sup>or</sup> Facebook <sub>on</sub> your <sup>smartphone</sup> and <sub>dive</sub> deep <sup>in.</sup></h1></p>

   <p><h3>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe <sub>mountain</sub> has come <sup>to</sup> you.<h2> <strong></h2>Algorithms</strong> <sup>have picked</sup> everything <sub>for you.</sub></h3></p>

   <p> According to what you or your friends have read or seen before, they predict what you might like to see.</p> 

   <p>It feels great not to waste time in finding interesting things on so many websites.</p>

<p><h3>But are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency?</h3></p>

<p>In many apps, the votes we cast — the likes, the plusses, the stars, the hearts — are actually more related to cute avatars and celebrity status than to the substance of what’s posted.</p>

<p> A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-looking person can be left outside the Stream, while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.</p>

<p>And not only do the algorithms behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, they also tend to show us more of what we’ve already liked.</p>

<p> These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds with posts, pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.</p>
