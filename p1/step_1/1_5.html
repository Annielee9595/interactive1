    <p><h1 style="font-family:verdana;">The Stream</h1></p>
<br />


     <p><h3 style="font-family:verdana;">now dominates the way people receive information on the web. 
     	<br />Fewer users are directly checking dedicated webpages, <br />instead getting fed by a never-ending flow of information that’s picked for them <br />by complex –and secretive — <strong>algorithms.</strong></h3></p>
<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">The Stream means you don’t need to open <br />so many websites any more. <br />You don’t need numerous tabs. <br />You don’t even need a web browser. <br />You open Twitter or Facebook on your smartphone and dive deep in. <br />The mountain has come to you. Algorithms have picked everything for you. <br /><br /><br />According to what you or your friends have read or seen before,<br /> they predict what you might like to see. <br />It feels great not to waste time<br /> in finding interesting things on so many websites.</h3>

<p><h2 style="font-family:verdana;">But are we missing something here? What are we exchanging for efficiency?</h2>
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
<h3 style="font-family:verdana;">In many apps, the votes we cast — <br />the likes, the plusses, the <br />stars, the hearts — are actually <br />more related to cute avatars and celebrity status <br />than to the substance of what’s posted.</h3> <h3 style="font-family:verdana;">But are we missing something here? <br />What are we exchanging for efficien? <br />A most brilliant paragraph by some ordinary-<br />looking person can be left outside the Stream, <br />while the silly ramblings of a celebrity gain instant Internet presence.
And not only do the algorithms <br />behind the Stream equate newness and popularity with importance, <br />they also tend to show us more of what we’ve already liked.<br /> These services carefully scan our behaviour and delicately tailor our news feeds with posts,<br /> pictures and videos that they think we would most likely want to see.
