<h1>All of these examples of menus investigate relationships between menu icons and where they use them. <br />

In the Universal page, it shows examples of general menu icons. People use their own logo, home figures and hamburger icon for their menu. It is something everyone recognizes and easy to navigate. <br />

The Transformation page shows how hamburger icon change, it gives information or sometime just aesthetics. <br />

The Web page shows that there is not always a menu button because web pages have a lot of space. People use their own logo or site name. <br />

For the Mobile page, there is limited space on mobile devices compared with web pages. Mobile devices use universal menu icons, which everyone can recognize. <br />

All of these relationships of the menu icon depend on what platforms are being used. <br /></h1>
