<h1>All of these examples of menus investigate relationships between menu icons and where people use them. <br /><br />

&nbspIn the Universal page, it shows examples of general menu icons. People use their own logo, home figures and hamburger icon for their menu. It is something everyone recognizes and is easy to navigate. <br />
<br />
&nbspThe Transformation page shows how hamburger icon change, it gives information or sometimes it is just aesthetics. <br /><br />

&nbspThe Web page shows that there is not always a menu button because web pages have a lot of space. People sometimes use their own logo or site name. <br /><br />

&nbspFor the Mobile page, there is limited space on mobile devices compared to web pages. Icons need to be more simple, so mobile devices use universal menu icons, which everyone can recognize.  <br /><br />

&nbspAll of these relationships of the menu icon depend on what platforms are being used. <br /></h1>
